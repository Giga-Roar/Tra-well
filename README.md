# To set up the project:
### Fill up the .env file
### Make changes to the config file. Some of those aren't utilized if I didn't get time to clean it up
### Open and login to your mysql in cmd. Copy the server/database.sql and paste it into the mysql cmd.

# To start using the website run the following on separate terminals within the project directory:
